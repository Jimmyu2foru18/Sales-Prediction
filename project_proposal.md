# BigMart Sales Prediction Project Proposal

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sales prediction system for BigMart stores using historical sales data. The system will help predict future sales for various products across different stores, enabling better inventory management and business planning.

## Objectives
1. Develop a robust sales prediction model
2. Identify key factors influencing product sales
3. Provide actionable insights for inventory management
- Create a scalable Python-based solution

## Technical Approach

### Data Processing
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Data normalization

### Model Development
- Implement regression models using Weka
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Cross-validation

### Implementation
- Java-based solution
- Weka integration
- Modular code structure

## Project Timeline
1. Data Preparation (1 week)
2. Model Development (2 weeks)
3. Testing and Optimization (1 week)
4. Documentation (3 days)
